# Smart Sleeve
This Smart Sleeve was built as a proof of concept to a bigger vision of a smart gymwear that is able to assist gym goers in correcting their workout form. The Smart Sleeve is designed to monitor multiple metrics of the workout form while performing the bicep curl excercise and provide corrective feedback to the user.
